### Understanding Key API and Software Concepts

* **API(Application Programming Interface):** APIs, Google Map API, enable communication between softwares by defining rules and methods for interactions.

* **SDK(Software Development Kit):** SDKs, such as Android SDk, provides tools, libraries and documnetation to build platform specific applications.

* **Web API:** Examples like RESTfull, provides interaction over HTTP for services, like fetching weather data from OPENWHEATER.

* **Library APIs:** Libraries like Numpy offer APIs for mathematical operations, enabling efficient coding with predefined functions.

* **Prompting and Completion:** In AI, prompting (e.g., "Write a poem") refers to inputting specfic instruction to the model like GPT, while completion generates meaningful responses or outputs based on the prompt.
